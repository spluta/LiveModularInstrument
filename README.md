# LiveModularInstrument

Over the past decade-plus I have been developing this software instrument, written in SuperCollider, for live performance with instrumentalists. This software is the main focus of my research, and almost every piece of electronic music found on my website uses it in some way. The unique non-linear design of my software helps me achieve a unique versatility as a performer, able to approach any musical situation with attentive sensitivity, and lead and follow in any group. Please read my Doctoral Dissertation, "Laptop Improvisation in a Multidimensional Space" for an overview of its workings.

I do not support this software for others to use, but provide this here as information for the community. Please feel free to read my code, steal my code, and make it your own.
